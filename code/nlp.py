CLASS: Natural Language Processing
What is NLP?
- Using computers to process (analyze, understand, generate) natural human languages
Why NLP?
- Most knowledge created by humans is unstructured text
- Need some way to make sense of it
- Enables quantitative analysis of text data
Why NLTK?
- High-quality, reusable NLP functionality

'''
Tokenization
What:  Separate text into units such as sentences or words
Why:   Gives structure to previously unstructured text
Notes: Relatively easy with English language text, not easy with some languages
'''

# "corpora" = plural form of corpus

    text += paragraph.text + " "
# Data Science corpus

# Put each word in clean_tokens in lower case
# find the new word count of the lowered tokens
# Then show the top 10 words used in this corpus














# ANSWER

'''
Stemming
What:  Reduce a word to its base/stem form
Why:   Often makes sense to treat multiple word forms the same way
Notes: Uses a "simple" and fast rule-based approach
       Output can be undesirable for irregular words
       Stemmed words are usually not shown to users (used for analysis/indexing)
       Some search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms
'''

from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer
stemmer = SnowballStemmer('english')

# example stemming
stemmer.stem('charge')
stemmer.stem('charging')
stemmer.stem('charged')

# stem the tokens
stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(t) for t in clean_tokens]

# count the stemmed tokens
c = Counter(stemmed_tokens)
c.most_common(25)       # all lowercase
sorted(c.items())[:25]  # some are strange


'''
Lemmatization
What:  Derive the canonical form ('lemma') of a word
Why:   Can be better than stemming, reduces words to a 'normal' form.
Notes: Uses a dictionary-based approach (slower than stemming)
'''

lemmatizer = nltk.WordNetLemmatizer()

# compare stemmer to lemmatizer
stemmer.stem('dogs')
lemmatizer.lemmatize('dogs')

stemmer.stem('wolves') # Beter for information retrieval and search
lemmatizer.lemmatize('wolves') # Better for text analysis

stemmer.stem('is')
lemmatizer.lemmatize('is')
lemmatizer.lemmatize('is',pos='v')

'''
Part of Speech Tagging
What:  Determine the part of speech of a word
Why:   This can inform other methods and models such as Named Entity Recognition
Notes: http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html
'''

temp_sent = 'Hunter is a great teacher!'
# pos_tag takes a tokenize sentence
nltk.pos_tag(nltk.word_tokenize(temp_sent))


'''
Stopword Removal
What:  Remove common words that will likely appear in any text
Why:   They don't tell you much about your text
'''

# most of top 25 stemmed tokens are "worthless"
c.most_common(25)

# view the list of stopwords
stopwords = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')
sorted(stopwords)


##################
### Exercise  ####
##################


# Create a variable called stemmed_stops which is the 
# stemmed version of each stopword in stopwords
# Use the stemmer we used up above!

# Then create a list called stemmed_tokens_no_stop that 
# contains only the tokens in stemmed_tokens that aren't in 
# stemmed_stops

# Show the 25 most common stemmed non stop word tokens










# Answers

# stem the stopwords
stemmed_stops = [stemmer.stem(t) for t in stopwords]

# remove stopwords from stemmed tokens
stemmed_tokens_no_stop = [t for t in stemmed_tokens if t not in stemmed_stops]

'''
Named Entity Recognition
What:  Automatically extract the names of people, places, organizations, etc.
Why:   Can help you to identify "important" words
Notes: Training NER classifier requires a lot of annotated training data
       Should be trained on data relevant to your task
       Stanford NER classifier is the "gold standard"

'''
Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
What:  Computes "relative frequency" that a word appears in a document
           compared to its frequency across all documents
Why:   More useful than "term frequency" for identifying "important" words in
           each document (high frequency in that document, low frequency in
           other documents)
Notes: Used for search engine scoring, text summarization, document clustering
How: 
    TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).
    IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it).
