Initialize weights randomly with mean 0
Note that it is a 3 x 1 matrix. This is because
we have two layers, an input of 3 dimensions and an output of 
one dimenension. IF we had more than two layers, we would 
need more than one matrix

Again these represent our initial weights, 
if syn0 == 
array([[-0.16595599],
       [ 0.44064899],
       [-0.99977125]])
Then initially our first observation would be:
-.17*0 + .44 * 0 + -.99 * 1 = - 0.99
then we would do nonlin(-0.99) = 0.2709 giving us a 
signal (response) of 0.27
Our l1_error would be -0.27 = (actual - prediction) = (0 - 0.27)
our l1_delta is the error time the slope on the sigmoid function
    l1_error * nonlin(- 0.99, True) = -0.064
so our first example gives the signal to roll back on the weights 
by 0.064 downwards.
