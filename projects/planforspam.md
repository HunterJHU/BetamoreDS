Plan for spam
=============

Read Paul Graham's [article](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html) on a plam for spam. Here's some questions to think about...

*	Should a spam filter optimize for sensitivity or specificity, in Paul's opinion?
*	Before he tried the "statistical approach" to spam filtering, what was his approach?
*	How exactly does his statistical filtering system work?
*	What did Paul say were some of the benefits of the statistical approach?
*	How good was his prediction of the "spam of the future"?
